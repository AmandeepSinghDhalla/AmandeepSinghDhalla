### Bonjour 🙏
### My name is Amandeep Singh. I am a Data Science Intern, Machine Learning and Deep Learning Enthusiast who is on a path to learn and explore everything that this amazing field of science has to offer. 

You are most welcome to explore my learning and professional journey and maybe add a little something to it 😋. I am delighted to meet new people and communicate with them as it helps me grow both as a professional and as a person. I am trying to perfect the skills required to become a good Deep Learning Engineer.  

### In my Github profile, you will find different repositories where I have tried to showcase my learning over the period, where you can see my growth as well as the projects that I have worked on during my professional career.

Apart from my professional career, I love to spend time with my family and friends. In my free time, I prefer to play sports like volleyball or football. I tend to do some good storytelling, so I watch Anime or read some Mangas. So, I would also learn a bit of Animation along the way 😅.
